Interface for communicating with a remote chrome instance via the Chrome 
Remote Debugger protocol.

Automatic wrapper class creation for the remote interface by parsing
the chrome `protocol.json` file, and dynamic code generation through dynamic 
AST building.

A higher level automation layer is implemented on top of the autogenerated 
wrapper, for manual use.


Transport layer (originally) from https://github.com/minektur/chrome_remote_shell
