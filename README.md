### Chrome Remote Debug Protocol interface layer and toolkit.

Interface for communicating/controlling a remote chrome instance via the Chrome 
Remote Debugger protocol.

Automatic wrapper class creation for the remote interface by parsing
the chrome `protocol.json` file, and dynamic code generation through dynamic 
AST building. While this is not the most maintainable design, I chose it mostly
because I wanted an excuse to learn/experiment with python AST manipulation.

A higher level automation layer is implemented on top of the autogenerated 
wrapper. Higher-level interface documentation is very much a work in process
at the moment.

Interface documentation is here: https://fake-name.github.io/ChromeController/ChromeController.CromeRemoteDebugInterface.html

Tested only on python 3.4 and 3.5 on linux. If you are using python 2, please stahp. 
Will probably work with normal chromium/windows, but that's not tested. My 
use-case is controlling chromium's `headless_shell`, and the system I do testing 
on has no X install at all, so non-headless testing is not something I can do
at the moment.

Note that this tool generates and manipulates the AST directly, so it is 
EXTREMELY sensitive to implementation details. It is *probably* broken on 
python 3.6 or < 3.4.
